    "# Overview of python\n",

    "*By: Sherif Abdulkader Tawfik Abbas, https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NhT7vZIAAAAJ, https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheriftawfik/\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics we will cover:\n",
    "- Bird's eye view on machine learning\n",
    "- Google Colab\n",
    "- Basic python: \n",
    "  - Variables\n",
    "  - Operations\n",
    "  - Control statements: `if` statement, `for` loop, `while` loop\n",
    "  - Collections: `list`, `tuple`, `dictionary`\n",
    "- Importing python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is about training the machine (a computer program) to make predictions of something. This something could be:\n",
    "- Is this CT scan that of a COVID-19 patient? Here, a category is predicted: a `yes` or a `no`.\n",
    "- Does this image indicate cervical cancer? Again, a category is predicted: a `yes` or a `no`. The machine can sub-categorize several classes of cancer.\n",
    "- What will the temperature be tomorrow? Here, a number is predicted, which is the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, you can predict a numerical property, or a categorical property. When you predict a numerical property, the machine learning problem is called a *regression problem*. In the case of a categorical prediction, this is the *classification problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both problems, one needs to process *data* using a programming language. This data comes in many possible forms:\n",
    "- Text data: sequence of characters, words\n",
    "- Numerical data\n",
    "- Images: 2D numerical data\n",
    "- Genome: DNA sequences, which is essentially text data\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has evolved as one of the programming languages that has the richest set of tools for dealing with the above data forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to learn to program in python and you don't have python installed on your computer, or you don't wish to struggle with the headache of setting it up, then you can use the Google Colab. This is a website that was developed by Google and is publicly available for anyone to use. It is pretty much an online python compiler, where you can write python code and run it, all on your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial, as you can see, is already running on Google Colab (let's just call it Colab from now on). On Colab, you can create python **notebooks**, which are known as Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is a programming environment for python that allows the programmer to write documents, just like this one, where there is both text and code. To demonstrate the placement of code here, check out the below section. This is some python code that prints out the text `\"Hello material science!\"`. Press the play button, and it will run that code, and actually print out `\"Hello material science!\"`."

    "\n",
    "How do we get the computer to print out this question on the screen? For that, we use the print statement. This statement orders the computer to print *something* to the screen. That something is called a *string*, which we will deal with shortly.\n",

    "A `list` in python is exactly what its name suggests, a list of things. Like a list of numbers, names, or even a mix of both. To create a list, we have to follow a simple syntax rule: enclose the things in the list between two *square brackets*, like those `[` and `]`, and separate between the list elements using commas, `,`. So for example, here is a list of numbers: `a = [4,6,7,1,0]`, a list of strings: `a = [\"a\",\"?\",\"neptune is a planet\"]`, a list of both: `a = [3,0,\"Where is my car?\"]`.\n",

    "- By using the `inset()` function if you want to add an item at a specified index e.g. `a = [1,2,3];a.insert(1,4);print(a)` gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.\n",
